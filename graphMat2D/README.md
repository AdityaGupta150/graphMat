# Graph Matrix 2D

This was the actual matrix implementation initially, and is much simpler in function to the GraphMat 3D.
**It might not have more maintainance**, that's why i am not maintaining it, it will have auto expansion implemented likely, if anymore queries please do create an issue in the issue section.

Also if these are not required then a simple `std::vector<std::vector<>>` or a `std::list<std::list<>>` may also help :D
